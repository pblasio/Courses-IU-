// whatever you give to a function in c is called an arguement 
// what you get back is called the return 
// ints the function will return integers, a function may not need arguements it may inside the () 
// a function is an entity that can perfrom a subtask
// if you do not have an explicit return statement of return 0 because the int is supposed to retrun a number value.
